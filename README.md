iXen's ambition is to overcome the limits of existing IoT platforms in the cloud and deal with challenges of security
and interoperability. Therefore, iXen is interoperable and expandable (i.e. services can be added or removed) while being
secure by design: access to services is granted only to authorized users (or other services) based on user roles and access
policies. Leveraging principles of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and the most recent EU standards for context
information management, iXen is implemented as a composition of RESTful micro-services in the cloud. iXen adopts a
3-tier architecture design model. The first layer supports connectivity of the vast diversity of IoT devices with the cloud.
The second (middle) layer implements IoT data functionality including, database, security and context management
services allowing devices to publish information and, users (or other services) subscribed to devices to get notified about
the availability of this information. Flow-based programming services in the middle layer allow fast development of new
applications by wiring together IoT devices and services. The third layer makes IoT applications available to customers
based on subscriptions. The experimental analysis shows that iXen is responding in real-time to complex service requests
under heavy workloads
